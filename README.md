## Quick rundown
Hello! This is an old weather system I created for a game that's no longer with us (rest in peace TAKT), it's pretty simple to use and is lag free as long as you remember to run it on the client!

## Usage
### Weather:Start()
**Start Function; Starts a weather effect at a certain position/region </br>**
Example usage:
>	WeatherUtilities:Start("Snow", script.Parent, 15)

### Weather:Random()
**Random Function; Returns a random weather effect.** </br>
Example usage:
>	WeatherUtilities:Random(script.Parent)
